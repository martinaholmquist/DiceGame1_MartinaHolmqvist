My first game, an interactive dice game. 
                                               
It all starts with players choosing                       
the number of players, rounds,                               
and the number of dice to be rolled.                            
The game is played and the results are shown.                   
If one player manages to score the same amount                  
of points as another player, they get an extra turn.                                                           
The player with the highest score wins!                         
                                                                 
 Good luck!
